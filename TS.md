# TypeScript

### 1. What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a **superset** of JavaScript that adds **static typing**, **interfaces**, and other powerful features. It helps catch errors early and improve code quality.

> JavaScript was created in just 10 days, which led to some limitations and unexpected behaviors. TypeScript helps fix these issues by adding a layer of type safety on top of JavaScript.

#### ⚠️ Problem Example in JavaScript:

```javascript
var a = 10;
var a = 12; // ✅ This works in JS (but can cause confusion)
// ❌ This would throw an error in most other languages
```
